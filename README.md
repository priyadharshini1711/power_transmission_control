## General Information
- This project is developed as a part of mini project level.
- This project is aimed to detect power transmission failure in the distributed power supply.
- This will detect the deviation in the circuitry orbit and transmit message to the central unit regarding the deviation.
- This was developed with inbuilt SMS and calling services during the power failure in the lines

## Technologies Used
- C
- Arduino UNO
- GSM Circuit


## Features
- The project has the circuit setup to detect the transmission line failure.
- The circuit is built to detect the power line deviation and transmit signals to the central transmission unit.
- Even the SMS and call alerts are also sent to eh central transmission unit to disrupt the power immediately in order to avoid accidents.
- Automatic power suspension can also be extend in this circuitry's pace
